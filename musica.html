<h1>Save your Tears</h1>
<br>
    Ooh
Na-na, yeah<br>
I saw you dancing in a crowded room<br>
You look so happy when I'm not with you<br>
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise<br>
A single teardrop falling from your eye<br>
I don't know why I run away<br>
I'll make you cry when I run away<br>
You could've asked me why I broke your heart<br>
You could've told me that you fell apart<br>
But you walked past me like I wasn't there<br>
And just pretended like you didn't care<br>
I don't know why I run away<br>
I'll make you cry when I run away<br>
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay<br>
Save your tears for another<br>
Save your tears for another day<br>
Save your tears for another day<br>
So, I made you think that I would always stay<br>
I said some things that I should never say<br>
Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine<br>
And now you won't love me for a second time<br>
I don't know why I run away, oh, girl<br>
Said I'll make you cry when I run away<br>
Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay<br>
Save your tears for another<br>
I realize that I'm much too late<br>
And you deserve someone better<br>
Save your tears for another day (ooh, yeah)<br>
Save your tears for another day (yeah)<br>
I don't know why I run away<br>
I'll make you cry when I run away<br>
Save your tears for another day, ooh, girl (ah)<br>
I said save your tears for another day (ah)<br>
Save your tears for another day (ah)<br>
Save your tears for another day (ah)<br>
